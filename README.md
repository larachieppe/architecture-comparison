# A comparative analysis between ResNet-152 and DenseNet-121 for Multiclass Brain Tumor Classification

Here is the code for a 4-class diagnosis of brain tumors. It was developed mainly with the goal of comparing two tranfer learning Convolutional Neural Network architectures: ResNet-152 abd DenseNet-121. The code contains data preprocessing, the creation of a 13-layer model, and the evaluaton the modelâ€™s performance with each architecture when considering parameter count, value loss, and value AUC.
